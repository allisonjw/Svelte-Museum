# Svelte Galleria

[Allison Wagner](https://github.com/allisonjw)

This goal of this project was to push myself to learn a Svelte and create a project utilizing the [Havard Museum API](https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/). Welcome to Svelte Galleria! A user can navigate between six selected art classifications and see a small selection of the art that is at the Havard Museum. To see more about an art piece, follow the url to the museum's website. Also, to see a larger image the user can click a button and a modal will pop-up with the artwork's image.

## Setup

Clone down the repo. Run ```npm install```, ```npm run dev``` and navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.
